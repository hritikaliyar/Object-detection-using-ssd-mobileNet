Here we are using ssd mobileNet V2 pretrained model which is trained on coco dataset.

Aim: Our main aim here is to perform object detection in images 

Tools: we are using tensorflow deeplearning library to perform object detection

Model: We are using pretained model to perform object detection

Sample of the my work:
